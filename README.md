# Brain Games Description

**Brain Games** is a set of command-line mini-games designed to train your logic and math skills
This project was developed as part of the [Hexlet](https://en.hexlet.io/) QA Engineer course
Each game asks the user a simple question. Answer correctly three times in a row to win the game

## Games included

**brain-even** - determine if a number is even
**brain-calc** - solve a basic arithmetic expression
**brain-gcd** - find the greatest common divisor of two numbers
**brain-progression** - find the missing number in an arithmetic progression
**brain-prime** - determine whether a number is prime

## System requirements

Node.js ≥ 18
npm ≥ 7
